## TRAINS and TOWNS problem

Path counting tasks were implemented using BFS over the adjecency matrix

Optimal distance tasks were implemented using Dijkstra algorithm with priority queue.

In order to run the code, inside src/com/interview/task folder run:
```no-highlight
javac -d . *.java
```
and then run this line with graph as an command line argument in quotes:

```no-highlight
java com.interview.task.Main "AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7"
```
